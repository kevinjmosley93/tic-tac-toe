# Tic-Tac-Toe

This is my first Project at GA. this application allows users to play a friendly game of Tic-Tac-Toe against themselves.

## Planning Story

I first started to work on the design and logic of my sign-in/sign-up forms, moved to my game board and then began to work on the game logic. I got caught up in overthinking most of the tasks which took up an unnecessary amount of time.

### User Stories

- As a user I am able to Sign up for an account.
- As a user I am able to login to my account. 
- As a user I am able to view how many games I have played.
- As a user I am able to play against myself and track how many wins I have.

### Technologies Used

- HTML/CSS
- jQuery
- Bootstrap
- Javascript
- Sass

### Unsolved Problems

- I still need to update game board through patch request when clicked.
